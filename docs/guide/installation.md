# Installation

## Creating a new project

The easiest way to start a new project based on **Orion**, **Vue 3** and **Vite** is to install and use **Orion CLI**.\
Look at the following steps or visit the official repo [**Orion CLI**](https://github.com/orion-ui/orion-cli)

``` sh:no-line-numbers
# Install Orion CLI globally
npm i -g @orion.ui/orion-cli

# Trigger CLI
orion
```

## Installing via NPM

``` sh:no-line-numbers
# Go in your project root folder
cd my-project

# If it's not an npm project yet
npm init

# Then install Orion
npm install --save @orion.ui/orion
```

That's it ! **Orion** is now part of your dependencies and can be used in your project.\
